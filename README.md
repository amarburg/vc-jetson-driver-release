n.b. This repository is a mashup of the [Allied Vision Alvium CSI Driver for Jetpack 6](https://github.com/alliedvision/alvium-jetson-driver-release) and the [Vision Components MIPI driver](https://github.com/VC-MIPI-modules/vc_mipi_nvidia)

# Vision Components MIPI driver for Jetpack 6 

## Submodule status:

Following the pattern from the [AVT driver package](https://github.com/alliedvision/alvium-jetson-driver-release), the four Nvidia OOT kernel packages are included as submodules:

 * `nvidia-hwpm`, `nvidia-nvethernetrm`, and `nvidia-nvgpu` use the upstream repos from _Nvidia's_ git server.
 * `nvidia-oot` points to [my nvidia-oot repo](https://github.com/apl-ocean-engineering/nvidia-oot) which contains the Nvidia OOT module source with the [VC patches](https://github.com/VC-MIPI-modules/vc_mipi_nvidia/tree/master/patch/kernel_Xavier_36.2.0%2B) applied.  

The `vc-mipi-driver` contain copies the VC module sources [from their repo](https://github.com/VC-MIPI-modules/vc_mipi_nvidia/tree/master/src), rearranged for this build system.

## Building
1. Clone this repository including all submodules
2. Download the Jetson Linux driver package (BSP) and cross compiler from: [Jetson Linux Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-linux)
3. Extract the driver package **in this directory**: 
    ```shell
        tar -xf jetson_linux_r36*.bz2
    ```
4. Extract the kernel headers from the driver package in the `Linux_for_Tegra/kernel` directory:
    ```shell
        cd Linux_for_Tegra/kernel/
        tar -xf kernel_headers.tbz2
    ```
5. Extract the cross compiler **in this directory**:
   ```shell
        cd ../../
        tar -xf aarch64--glibc--stable-2022.08-1.tar.bz2
   ```
6. Set the following environment variables ( `source setup.sh` is a convenience alias):
    ```shell
        export ARCH=arm64
        export CROSS_COMPILE=$(pwd)/aarch64--glibc--stable-2022.08-1/bin/aarch64-buildroot-linux-gnu-
        export KERNEL_SRC=Linux_for_Tegra/kernel/linux-headers-*-linux_x86_64/3rdparty/canonical/linux-jammy/kernel-source/

        export INSTALL_MOD_PATH=$(pwd)/install
    ```

7. Build everything:
    ```shell
        make all 
    ```

8. Install:
    ```shell
        make install
    ```

At this point the rebuilt kernel modules -- including both the new VC modules and a few customized versions of NVidia camera handler modules -- and additional device tree overlays can be installed onto a Jetson.   This can be done either by building a new set of images and flashing them to the device (essentially replacing the install process done through SDK Manager), or by installing them on an already-running module.  For simplicity, my focus is the latter ....

## Installing on a running Nano

1. Copy the install directory to the device (called 'nano' in this case):

   ```shell
        scp -r install nano:~
   ```

2. Log into the device, and copy the files into place (this could be automated!)

   ```shell
       ssh nano
       sudo cp -a install/lib/modules/5.15.148-tegra/updates /lib/modules/5.15.148-tegra
       sudo cp -a install/boot/* /boot/
   ```

3. Instruct the bootloader to apply the device tree overlay on startup.  This can be done manually by editing the `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf` file, though the `jetson-io` wrapper can be used to automated the process, either graphically with:

   ```shell
       sudo /opt/nvidio/jetson-io/jetson-io.py
   ```

   or

   ```shell
       sudo ./config-by-hardware.py -n 2="Camera VCMIPI Dual"
   ```

   Which instructs the scripts to install the overlay "Camera VCMIPI Dual" (this name is baked into the overlay file `tegra234-p3767-camera-p3768-vc_mipi-dual-imx.dtbo`) for header "2" (the CSI Camera header).

   4. Confirm the changes have created a new entry in `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf`
   5. Reboot
